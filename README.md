## Integrative modeling of the different INO80 states

# Modeling

- mod_small_three_states: modeling of three states of the ACT1-ARP4-ARP8 based on three different crosslinking data sets.

- mod_INO80_nucleosome: modeling of the yeast INO80 based on the structure of the human INO80 complex. In this modeling instance the human structure is mantained fixed. 

# Alignments

Script to generate the sequence alignments between related proteins from different species. 
Uses psi-blast and tcoffee.
